# Palestine Datasets

[data.techforpalestine.org](https://data.techforpalestine.org)

This repo provides an open source dataset intended to show the human toll of the 2023/2024 Gaza Nakba. This is not limited to Gaza and may include the West Bank. There are two primary datasets:

- `martyrs.json` has a list of martyrs with their name, age, sex
- `casualties_daily.json` has daily reports of aggregate martyr & injury counts from October 7th to the latest reported day

There's also the source for the static documentation site.

See sub readmes for more info on data sources in [english](site/docs) or [arabic](site/i18n/ar/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs) which are also published on the site.
