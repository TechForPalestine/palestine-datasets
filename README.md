# Palestine Datasets

[data.techforpalestine.org](https://data.techforpalestine.org)

This repo provides an open source dataset intended to show the human toll of Israel's war on Gaza. This is not limited to Gaza and may include the West Bank. There are two primary datasets:

- `martyrs.json` has a list of martyrs with their name, age, sex
- `casualties_daily.json` has daily reports of aggregate martyr & injury counts from October 7th to the latest reported day

There's also the source for the static documentation site.

See sub readmes for more info on data sources in [english](site/docs) or [arabic](site/i18n/ar/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs) which are also published on the site.
