## Source

The file is updated when a new list is released by Gaza's Government Media Office or when we receive incremental updates about new individual incidents. We source these from the [Ministry's Telegram Channel](https://t.me/s/mediagovps).

The ministry has previously released photos of some of those killed, which you can retrieve in Arabic and English from their [public Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1GLRsBdatR9rWyLbQKIh3crQe1xvinzna). As of writing, it includes photos for just over half of the list.
