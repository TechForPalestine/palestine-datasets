## Daily Sources

For West Bank data, we depend on [UN OCHA](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties).

There are two types source material they provide that we use to build the time series:

- `verified` - These are the ones independently verified by [UN OCHA personnel](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties) and provided via their casualty database.
- `flash-updates` - These are incidents reported to the UN, but [not yet verified](https://www.ochaopt.org/crisis) and they are the source of those root level values in the above report object.

Verified values will lag the ones that come from Flash Updates, so the field will be missing (optional) on more recent report dates, but generally continuous going back through older report dates once populated values are encountered.

Flash Updates occasionally miss days and [as of March 25](/updates/west-bank-frequency) are only available for the West Bank on a weekly basis.
