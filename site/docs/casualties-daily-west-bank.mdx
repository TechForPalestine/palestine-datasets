## Daily Sources

For West Bank data, we depend on [UN OCHA](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties). 

There are two types values for daily casualty reports we use to build the time series:

- `verified` - These are the ones independently verified by the [UN OCHA personnel](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties). 
- `flash-updates` - These are incidents reported to the UN, but [not yet verified](https://www.ochaopt.org/crisis) and they are the source of those root level values not in the `verified` sub-object.
