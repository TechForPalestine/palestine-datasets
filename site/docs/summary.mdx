- for [Killed in Gaza](/docs/killed-in-gaza) it provides composition information by gender and age group
- for Daily Casualties in [Gaza](/docs/casualties-daily) and the [West Bank](/docs/casualties-daily-west-bank) it provides cumulative values from the latest reported day

## Usage

import { JSONFileLinks } from "@site/src/components";

<JSONFileLinks resource="Summary_V3" />

The file is updated whenever the other datasets are updated (typically daily).

### `known_press_killed_in_gaza`

Includes the count of records in the [Press Killed in Gaza dataset](/docs/press-killed-in-gaza):

| records    | number of names in the list |

If you want the latest number of journalists killed in Gaza, consider using the `killed.press` value from the `gaza` section, above. This value is reported independently and while we aim to keep it in sync, the name list updates may lag the daily casualties counts.

## Killed Children by Name Usage

This dataset, combined with the [count of child names](/docs/killed-in-gaza/#child-name-counts) from our Killed in Gaza dataset, is used to derive an estimate of how many children with a particular name have been killed so far across Gaza and the West Bank. The logic for this calculation can be [seen here in javascript on Github](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/palestine-datasets/blob/main/scripts/data/v2/derived/killed-child-name-counts.ts). It's available as a JSON API that updates as both this summary dataset and our Killed in Gaza names list receive updates:

```

```
