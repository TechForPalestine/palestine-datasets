## Daily Sources

There are four source values for daily casualty reports we use to build the time series:

- `mohtel` - [Gaza's Ministry of Health Telegram channel](https://t.me/s/MOHMediaGaza)
- `gmotel` - [Gaza's Government Media Office Telegram channel](https://t.me/s/mediagovps)
- `missing` - No official report was available for the given date (some reasons below)

Our methodology is to prioritize official sources for this dataset in order to best align the reporting time periods (`mohtel` falling back to `gmotel`). When communications were cut to Gaza, `gmotel` would provide reporting but in some cases neither would. Reports were also stopped during the humanitarian pause.

## Extrapolated (`ext_` fields)

Since official numbers weren't always available, and it can be useful to have a timeseries where all dates have values, we're providing the same official fields in extrapolated form using the following methodology:

- if the missing field was a cumulative one and we had an official report for a daily killed or injury count, we calculate the cumulative using the daily increment
- if the missing field was a daily increment and we had cumulative counts, we subtracted the reported cumulative count from the prior period for the missing daily count
- if we were missing both sets of numbers for a given reporting period we average the difference between surrounding periods
