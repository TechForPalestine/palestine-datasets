# Killed in Gaza

## Usage

The dataset is available as a CSV and JSON array. For programmatic use cases, we recommend sequentially requesting segments of the list using the [paged JSON option](#paging), but a full minified JSON list is also provided below.

import { JSONFileLinks } from "@site/src/components";

<JSONFileLinks resource="KilledInGaza_V3" minifiedOnly />

You can replace the `v3` path in these links with `v2` for our older format. For JSON we recommend `v3` as it's a faster download. See [versions](#versions).

### Paging

<KilledListPagingLabel />

You can dynamically fetch the current page size and number of pages using our [Summary JSON](/docs/summary). We recommend fetching this resource before & after a sequential fetch to confirm that the page count was stable (makes sure the list wasn't updated while you were requesting all the pages).

## Versions

We maintain two formats of this dataset: a v2 and v3 version. Both receive updates as we receive list updates from the ministry. These versions represent data format changes and not unique list updates. For unique list update numbering refer to the `update` field noted above (only available for the v3 format).

v2 has the [paged format](#paging) noted above alongside CSV and JSON. v3 provides CSV & JSON in a condensed format. The v3 format does not include the "source" field that's in v2. We removed the source field after the ministry stopped using it in the [sixth list update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-6/). To keep the v3 JSON format small, we've switched the format from an array of JSON objects to an array of arrays, similar to a CSV. The first array specifies the fields and their order for the rest of the records in the main array.

## Source

The file is updated when a new list is released by Gaza's Ministry of Health.

In their initial January 2024 update, the Ministry indicated the following about the list:

1. The missing persons and the bodies of those trapped under the rubble were not counted.
2. The unidentified people who arrived at hospitals were not counted.
3. The unidentified persons whose bodies were handed over by the occupation were not counted.
4. Those who were buried by their families without passing through hospitals were not counted.
5. The victims in Gaza and North Gaza were not counted after the date of stopping the information system in November.

The aggregate numbers in the [Daily Casualties - Gaza](/docs/casualties-daily) dataset will necessarily diverge from this list due to the number of unidentified people.

## Child Name Counts

For counts of the top 10 translated first names by age group (man, woman, boy, and girl), you can reference this JSON API:

```
https://data.techforpalestine.org/api/v2/killed-in-gaza/name-freq-en.json
```

This dataset is used to derive estimates of children killed for our home page name cards as documented on our [Summary dataset page](/docs/summary/#killed-children-by-name-usage).
