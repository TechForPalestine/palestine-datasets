# Killed in Gaza

Latest data available is as of July 15, 2025 (see source info below).

<DocWarningBubble>
  The names & numbers we publish here are not fully representative of the human
  toll of Israel's actions in Gaza. [Read more about other factors you should
  consider](/updates/gaza-ministry-casualty-context/).

import {
  KilledListCountLabel,
  KilledListExplorer,
  KilledListPagingLabel,
} from "@site/src/components";

<KilledListCountLabel />
<KilledListExplorer />

## Usage

The dataset is available as a CSV and JSON array. Given the size of the dataset, the JSON array has grown too large to use anything other than our minified JSON. Even then, for new projects we recommend sequentially requesting segments of the dataset using our [Paging option](#paging).

import { JSONFileLinks } from "@site/src/components";

<JSONFileLinks resource="KilledInGaza_V2" minifiedOnly />

### Paging

<KilledListPagingLabel />

You can dynamically fetch the current page size and number of pages using our [Summary JSON](/docs/summary/#killed-children-by-name-usage). We recommend fetching this resource before & after a sequential fetch to confirm that the page count was stable (makes sure the list wasn't updated while you were requesting all the pages).

## English Name Translation

For a discussion of our translation methodology, [see our February update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-1).

## Child Name Counts

For counts of the top 10 translated first names by age group (man, woman, boy, and girl), you can reference this JSON API:

```
https://data.techforpalestine.org/api/v2/killed-in-gaza/name-freq-en.json
```

This dataset is used to derive estimates of children killed for our home page name cards as documented on our [Summary dataset page](/docs/summary/#killed-children-by-name-usage).

## Source

The file is updated when a new list is released by Gaza's Ministry of Health.

This list incorporates the following releases from the Ministry of Health:

- The first was as of January 5th for hospitals reporting in the South and November 2nd for the North. Additionally, 21 records were included from an earlier release as [noted in our Feburary update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-1#notable-changes).
- The second was as of March 29th, 2024 and it included submissions from the public to the Ministry (ie: families of those killed). We detailed the changes in our [April 13th update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-2).
- The third was as of April 30th, 2024 and released on May 5th from the Ministry. We detailed the changes in our [June 26th update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-3).
- The fourth was as of June 30th, 2024 and released on July 24th from the Ministry. We detailed the changes in our [September 7th update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-4).
- The fifth was as of August 31st, 2024 and released around September 15th by the Ministry. We detailed the changes in our [September 21st update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-5).
- The sixth was as of March 23rd, 2025, and released on the same day by the Ministry via Iraq Body Count. We detailed the changes in our [May 11th update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-6).
- The seventh was as of June 15th, 2025, and released on June 23rd from the Ministry via Iraq Body Count. We detailed the changes in our [July 6th update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-2025-06-15).
- The eighth was as of July 15th, 2025, and released on July 16th from the Ministry via Iraq Body Count. We detailed the changes in our [July 20th update](/updates/killed-in-gaza-update-2025-07-15).

In their initial January update, the Ministry indicated the following about the list:

1. The missing persons and the bodies of those trapped under the rubble were not counted.
2. The unidentified people who arrived at hospitals were not counted.
3. The unidentified persons whose bodies were handed over by the occupation were not counted.
4. Those who were buried by their families without passing through hospitals were not counted.
5. The victims in Gaza and North Gaza were not counted after the date of stopping the information system in November.

The aggregate numbers in the [Daily Casualties - Gaza](/docs/casualties-daily) dataset will necessarily diverge from this list due to the number of unidentified people.

## Prior Versions

During earlier updates we created snapshot CSVs of the dataset before an updated was applied. For more recent updates we have not provided this since our raw data and the changes are readily available for historical reference [via Github commit history](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/palestine-datasets/commits/main/killed-in-gaza.json).
