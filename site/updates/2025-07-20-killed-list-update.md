On July 16th, Gaza officials released a new list of those killed in Gaza up to July 15th, 2025.

The list format was very similar to recent updates we received. You can <a href="https://iraqbodycount.org/pal/moh_2025-07-15.xlsx" target="_blank">download an Excel file provided by Iraq Body Count here</a> that was used as the source for this update. This sheet was sourced by IBC from the Gaza Ministry of Health and formatted to include english names. You can <a href="https://x.com/iraqbodycount/status/1945493574969180593" target="_blank">view IBC's announcement here</a>.

Where age was provided in months, we've defaulted to age of 0.

## Methodology

Instead of using our own arabic-to-english name mapping as we've done in the past, we kept the translations provided by Iraq Body Count in the abovenoted excel list. We continued the following adjustments to the source report:

- renaming the columns to comply with our previous naming
- adding source `u` (unknown) since no origin source was provided by the Ministry of Health (in earlier releases they indicated which records were sourced by officials vs. from the public)
