Around September 15th, Gaza officials released a 649 page PDF on their WhatsApp channel representing the list of those killed in Gaza up to August 31st.

The list format was very similar to recent updates we received on the Ministry of Health's telegram channel. You can <a href="/sources/20240831gaza.pdf">download the PDF here</a> that was used as the source for this update. You can view the updated dataset on our [Killed in Gaza page](/docs/killed-in-gaza).

We noted the following changes to their reporting format from the last update:

- they've added a new source value to each record labeled either "judicial committee" or "house committee" which accounted for less than 5% of the records - the vast majority are still attributed to the Ministry of Health

## Methodology

We maintained the update method we last reported and continue to perform the following adjustments to the source report:

- normalizing the date of birth date format to YYYY-MM-DD
- converting the source field from arabic to an english abbreviation
- converting the sex/gender field from arabic to an english abbreviation
- adding the english name translation using our existing lookup tables
