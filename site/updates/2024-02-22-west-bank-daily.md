In a continuing effort to provide data that can be used to tell the Palestinian story since October 7th, we're adding a [new Daily Casualties dataset for the West Bank](/docs/casualties-daily-west-bank). This dataset aims to complement our existing [time series for Gaza](/docs/casualties-daily) so that they can be combined as needed.

We aim to update both datasets daily at the same time, and their latest values are now also reflected in a [new V3 version of our Summary dataset](/docs/summary). You can still access the existing V2 summary dataset and we will continue to update it as before, but we encourage upgrading.
