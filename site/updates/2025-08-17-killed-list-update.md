On August 4th, Gaza officials released a new list of those killed in Gaza up to July 31st, 2025.

The list format was very similar to recent updates we received. You can <a href="https://www.iraqbodycount.org/pal/moh_2025-07-31.xlsx" target="_blank">download an Excel file provided by Iraq Body Count here</a> that was used as the source for this update. This sheet was sourced by IBC from the Gaza Ministry of Health and formatted to include english names. You can <a href="https://x.com/iraqbodycount/status/1952795726292885546" target="_blank">view IBC's announcement here</a>.

Where age was provided in months, we've defaulted to age of 0.
