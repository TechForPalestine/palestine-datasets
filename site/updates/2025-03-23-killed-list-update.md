On March 23rd, 2025 Gaza officials released a 1516 page PDF representing the list of those killed in Gaza up to March 23rd, 2025.

The list format was very similar to recent updates we received earlier versions. You can <a href="/sources/<ADD_20250323_HERE>.pdf">download the PDF here</a> that was used as the source for this update. You can view the updated dataset on our [Killed in Gaza page](/docs/killed-in-gaza).

We noted the following changes to their reporting format from the last update:

## Methodology

We slightly change the update method we last reported and instead of using our own arabic to english name mapping we used [Iraq Body Count excel list](https://iraqbodycount.org/pal/ibc_moh_2025-03-23.xlsx) in order to expedite the process. The current process still used following adjustments to the source report:

- renaming header to comply with our previous naming
- adding source `u` i.e. unknown since no source was provided by Ministry of Heath
